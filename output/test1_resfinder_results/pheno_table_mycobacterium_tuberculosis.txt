# ResFinder phenotype results for mycobacterium tuberculosis.
# Sample: input_genome.fasta
# 
# The phenotype 'No resistance' should be interpreted with
# caution, as it only means that nothing in the used
# database indicate resistance, but resistance could exist
# from 'unknown' or not yet implemented sources.
# 
# The 'Match' column stores one of the integers 0, 1, 2, 3.
#      0: No match found
#      1: Match < 100% ID AND match length < ref length
#      2: Match < 100% ID AND match length = ref length
#      3: Match = 100% ID AND match length = ref length
# If several hits causing the same resistance are found,
# the highest number will be stored in the 'Match' column.
